    <h1>Hey, I'm Hugo!</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a Game Design student with a passion for Level & Quest Design. I love creating immersive environments, player-driven narratives, and worlds that tell stories beyond just dialogue.

  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>
    I've always been fascinated by storytelling and interactive worlds—whether through video games, D&D campaigns, or films. Studying at Futuregames, I've focused on Level & Quest Design, honing my skills in ProBuilder, Unreal Engine, player guidance techniques, and lighting for gameplay readability.

  <h2>Beyond Game Design</h2>
  <p>
    When I'm not designing levels, you'll find me climbing, playing with my dog, or diving into immersive RPGs and sims. These passions not only keep me active but also inspire the creativity I bring into my work.
