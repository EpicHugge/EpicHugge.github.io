<!-- MY JOURNEY: Background & Skills (with a background image and overlay) -->

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I've always been fascinated by storytelling and interactive worlds—whether in video games, D&D campaigns, or films. My passion led me to study Game Design at Futuregames, where I dove deep into Level & Quest Design. Along the way, I've honed my skills using tools like ProBuilder and Unreal Engine and mastered techniques in player guidance and lighting for gameplay readability.

  <h2>Beyond Game Design</h2>
  <p>
    When I'm not designing game levels, you'll find me out climbing, playing with my dog, or immersing myself in RPGs and immersive sims. These passions fuel my creativity and keep me inspired every day.
