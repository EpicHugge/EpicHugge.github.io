<!-- MY JOURNEY: Background & Skills -->
<section class="about-journey">
  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>
    I've always been fascinated by storytelling and interactive worlds—whether through video games, D&D campaigns, or films. Studying at Futuregames, I've focused on Level & Quest Design, honing my skills in ProBuilder, Unreal Engine, player guidance, and lighting for gameplay readability.

  <h2>Beyond Game Design</h2>
  <p>
    When I'm not designing game levels, you'll find me climbing, playing with my dog, or immersing myself in RPGs and immersive sims. These passions fuel my creativity and keep me inspired.
