<!-- 2) Short Introduction -->
Welcome to my **Level Design Assignment** for [Your Course/Class Name]! This project focuses on building a playable environment from **blockout** to **final polish**. Below, you’ll find a breakdown of the process, from initial layout to a completed, atmospheric level.

## Blockout Phase

<!-- 3) Blockout Screenshots & Description -->
During the **blockout phase**, I concentrated on:
- **Overall Layout**: Ensuring intuitive flow and pacing
- **Landmarks**: Creating focal points to guide the player
- **Scale Testing**: Checking line-of-sight distances and cover spacing

**Blockout Screenshots:**

I used greyboxes to define the main corridors and rooms, testing gameplay loops quickly before committing to final art.

## Final Level

<!-- 4) Final Level Screenshots & Explanation -->
Once the blockout felt right, I introduced **lighting**, **textures**, and **props** to bring the environment to life. My goals were:
- **Atmospheric Lighting**: Subtle glows to guide the player’s path
- **Story Hints**: Environmental storytelling with scattered objects
- **Enemy Placement**: Balanced challenge for stealth or combat

## Reflection & Lessons Learned

- **Iteration is Key**: Early blockouts allowed fast testing without overcommitting to art.
- **Player Guidance**: Subtle lighting cues worked better than heavy-handed arrows.
- **Performance**: Optimization early in blockout reduces hassle later.
