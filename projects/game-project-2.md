        <h2><strong>Transition</strong></h2>
        <p>
          I began the project as <strong>Sound &amp; Music Designer</strong>, with a secondary role 
          in Level Design. After the first week, I stepped into <strong>Level Design full-time</strong> 
          when the original designer had to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shift required me to <strong>quickly adapt</strong>, ensuring a smooth workflow for the team 
          while balancing <strong>combat, traversal, and level structure</strong> 
          within the project’s tight timeline.

        <h2><strong>Design</strong></h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>hook ability</strong> was originally intended for reaching high platforms, 
          but this conflicted with enemy AI, as they couldn't follow the player. 
          To fix this, I repositioned <strong>hook anchors</strong> to focus on <strong>speed 
          and traversal</strong> rather than vertical movement, allowing for 
          <strong>fluid mobility</strong> without breaking combat flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Playtesting led to the <strong>removal of excess platforms</strong> to keep 
          the brawler focus intact. I also fine-tuned <strong>ambush sections 
          and enemy placement</strong> to maintain a balanced difficulty curve 
          despite frequent AI tweaks.

        <h2><strong>Collaboration</strong></h2>
        <p>
          I worked closely with <strong>programmers, artists, and designers</strong> to balance 
          <strong>combat, traversal, and level flow</strong>. Frequent <strong>enemy AI tweaks</strong> 
          required ongoing adjustments to <strong>enemy placement and ambush pacing</strong> 
          to maintain fair difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also coordinated with <strong>programmers</strong> to align <strong>jump mechanics 
          with level design</strong>, ensuring platform spacing felt responsive. 
          Through continuous communication, I made sure <strong>all disciplines could 
          implement their work seamlessly</strong>, keeping the level balanced, polished, and fun.

        <h2><strong>Blockout</strong></h2>
        <p>
          I inherited an <strong>unfinished blockout</strong> with <strong>technical issues</strong> 
          that prevented the team from testing mechanics and implementing assets. 
          I <strong>quickly fixed the structure</strong>, ensuring the level was 
          <strong>fully playable and testable</strong> without blocking other disciplines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the foundation was stable, I focused on <strong>optimizing level flow</strong>, 
          adjusting <strong>pathing, spacing, and encounter pacing</strong> 
          to keep movement <strong>fluid</strong> and <strong>combat engaging</strong>. 
          This ensured a <strong>smooth development process</strong> while maintaining a 
          <strong>fun and responsive gameplay experience</strong>.

      <h2><strong>Reflections</strong></h2>
      <p>
        It's a Fish, Your Majesty challenged me to <strong>adapt quickly, problem-solve under pressure, 
        and collaborate across disciplines</strong>. Taking over Level Design mid-project, 
        I prioritized <strong>efficiency</strong>, ensuring a <strong>functional, testable level</strong> 
        without blocking development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned to <strong>balance combat and traversal</strong>, refining 
        <strong>enemy placement, encounter pacing, and platforming density</strong> 
        to keep movement fluid while maintaining the <strong>brawler focus</strong>. 
        Handling the <strong>hook traversal mechanic</strong> reinforced the importance of 
        <strong>mechanical cohesion</strong>, ensuring features complement rather than disrupt gameplay.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project strengthened my ability to <strong>iterate based on feedback</strong>, 
        quickly adjusting <strong>level structure, AI placement, and encounter flow</strong>. 
        It solidified my passion for <strong>Level Design</strong> and the value of 
        <strong>cross-discipline collaboration</strong> in game development.
