        <h2><strong>Design</strong></h2>
        <p>
          I chose a <strong>gatehouse setting</strong> to create a <strong>stealth-centric</strong> environment perfect for quiet, strategic gameplay. 
          The level features a <strong>dark, moody atmosphere</strong> that heightens tension, while a 
          <strong>clear spatial flow</strong>—achieved through <strong>strategic lighting</strong> and 
          <strong>verticality</strong>—guides players subtly. The <strong>high ground</strong> and 
          <strong>overlook position</strong> empower players to plan their routes effectively.

        <h2><strong>Narrative</strong></h2>
        <p>
          I used <strong>environmental storytelling, overheard dialogue, and NPC interaction</strong> 
          to immerse the player in a world of <strong>betrayal and corruption</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ushi Maki Ramen, a captured smuggler,</strong> offers a <strong>hidden escape</strong> in exchange for help. 
          Guards <strong>misuse his confiscated wares</strong>, revealing their corruption through 
          <strong>dialogue and scattered clues</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players choose between <strong>escaping through the main gate</strong> or <strong>helping Ushi</strong> 
          to access a <strong>hidden passage behind a bookshelf</strong>, rewarding exploration and choice.

      <div class="card-text">
        <h2><strong>Guiding the Player</strong></h2>
        <p>
          I designed the level to <strong>naturally guide players</strong> using 
          <strong>lighting, elevation, and composition</strong>. A <strong>high vantage point</strong> 
          lets players scan the <strong>open gatehouse</strong> and plan their route.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong>large window casts god rays onto the main gate</strong>, marking the objective, 
          while <strong>brightly lit paths contrast with darker side rooms</strong> to steer movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bright cloth on vaultable windows</strong> signals traversal points, and 
          <strong>verticality</strong> naturally increases difficulty. Starting high grants control, 
          while descending raises tension.

        <p>
          I started to create a <strong>hand-drawn layout</strong> and then I did 
          <strong>architectural research</strong>, then I built the <strong>blockout in ProBuilder (Unity)</strong> 
          and refined it through <strong>peer feedback</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To fix <strong>predictable symmetry</strong>, I <strong>added support beams on the lower floor</strong> 
          and a <strong>commander’s study on the upper floor</strong>, improving flow. 
          <strong>Lighting and environmental cues</strong> were adjusted to enhance <strong>player guidance</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These changes made the level <strong>more engaging</strong>, balancing 
          <strong>high-ground advantages</strong> with <strong>varied movement options</strong> 
          for a <strong>fluid experience</strong>.

      <h2><strong>Reflections</strong></h2>
      <p>
        This project taught me <strong>how to use ProBuilder and similar tools</strong> as well as 
        <strong>lighting techniques and player guidance</strong> in stealth-based level design.
        I learned the <strong>importance of giving players a vantage point early on</strong>, 
        allowing them to plan their route strategically.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest challenge was <strong>grasping the fundamentals of level design</strong>—from planning 
        the layout to using new tools like ProBuilder. At first, it was frustrating, but overcoming those 
        struggles helped me <strong>understand how to approach the early phases of level creation 
        more effectively</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I had more time, I would refine <strong>color usage, narrative elements, and lighting adjustments</strong> 
        to further enhance the atmosphere. I would also implement <strong>audio and music</strong>, 
        as I believe sound design could elevate the stealth experience by reinforcing tension and immersion.
