        <h2><strong>Design</strong></h2>
        <p>
          I chose a <strong>gatehouse setting</strong> to support stealth and slow planning. The space is <strong>dark and moody</strong> to build tension.
          <strong>Clear spatial flow</strong> uses <strong>lighting</strong> and <strong>verticality</strong> to guide players. The <strong>high ground</strong> overlook lets them plan routes.

        <h2><strong>Narrative</strong></h2>
        <p>
          I used <strong>environmental storytelling</strong> plus <strong>overheard dialogue</strong> and <strong>NPC interaction</strong> to pull the player into a story of <strong>betrayal and corruption</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ushi Maki Ramen</strong> is a captured smuggler. He offers a <strong>hidden escape</strong> if you help him.
          Guards <strong>misuse his confiscated wares</strong>. This shows their corruption through <strong>dialogue and scattered clues</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players can <strong>escape through the main gate</strong> or <strong>help Ushi</strong>. Helping him opens a <strong>hidden passage behind a bookshelf</strong>.
          It rewards exploration and choice.

        <h2><strong>Guiding the Player</strong></h2>
        <p>
          I designed the level to <strong>guide players</strong> using <strong>lighting</strong> and <strong>elevation</strong> plus <strong>composition</strong>.
          A <strong>high vantage point</strong> lets players scan the <strong>open gatehouse</strong> and plan their route.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong>large window casts god rays onto the main gate</strong>. This marks the objective.
          <strong>Bright paths</strong> contrast with <strong>darker side rooms</strong> to steer movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bright cloth on vaultable windows</strong> signals traversal points. <strong>Verticality</strong> raises difficulty over time.
          Starting high grants control. Dropping down raises tension.

        <p>
          I started with a <strong>hand-drawn layout</strong>. Then I did <strong>architectural research</strong>.
          I built the <strong>blockout in ProBuilder (Unity)</strong>. I refined it through <strong>peer feedback</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To break <strong>predictable symmetry</strong> I added <strong>support beams on the lower floor</strong> and a <strong>commander’s study on the upper floor</strong>.
          That improved flow. I also adjusted <strong>lighting and environmental cues</strong> to improve <strong>player guidance</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These changes made the level <strong>more engaging</strong>. High ground still mattered but movement options felt more varied.

      <h2><strong>Reflections</strong></h2>
      <p>
        This project taught me <strong>ProBuilder</strong> and similar tools. It also taught me <strong>lighting techniques</strong> and <strong>player guidance</strong> in stealth spaces.
        I learned the value of giving players a strong vantage point early so they can plan their route.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest challenge was learning the fundamentals. That meant planning the layout and using new tools like ProBuilder.
        It was frustrating at first. Working through it helped me approach early layout work with more confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        With more time I would refine <strong>color use</strong> and <strong>narrative beats</strong>. I would also refine <strong>lighting</strong>.
        I would add <strong>audio and music</strong>. Sound design would push tension and immersion.
